# LLM-Application-with-Google-Gemini-and-Langchain
# Overview
This project demonstrates how to build an LLM (Large Language Model) application using Google Gemini and Langchain, with a frontend built using Streamlit. The application allows users to upload multiple PDF documents, which are then processed and indexed using FAISS vector embeddings for efficient retrieval and interaction.

# Features
Upload multiple PDF documents via a user-friendly Streamlit interface
Convert PDFs into embeddings using Google Gemini Pro
Store and index embeddings using FAISS for fast search
Query the documents using natural language processing
Retrieve relevant content based on user queries

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Google Gemini Pro account
Required Python libraries:
Streamlit
Langchain
FAISS
PyPDF2 (or any other PDF processing library)
NumPy
Pandas (optional for data handling)
