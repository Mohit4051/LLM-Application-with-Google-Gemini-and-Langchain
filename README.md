# LLM-Application-with-Google-Gemini-and-Langchain
This project demonstrates how to build an LLM (Large Language Model) application using Google Gemini and Langchain, with a frontend built using Streamlit. The application allows users to upload multiple PDF documents, which are then processed and indexed using FAISS vector embeddings for efficient retrieval and interaction.
